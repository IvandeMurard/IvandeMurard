> Building AI-native tools for hospitality ops, urban sound, and vinyl culture.

Current Projects
----------------

- 🛏️ **[Hospitality Operations Agent](https://github.com/IvandeMurard/Hospitality-Operations-Agentic-AI-B2B/tree/main)** – AI copilot for hotel & F&B teams: from reservations to staffing and guest messaging, plugged into your existing tools (PMS-agnostic).  
- 🎧 **[Tacet](https://github.com/IvandeMurard/tacet-app)** – Mobile-first noise pollution companion: measure, track, and understand the soundscape around you.  
- 🧪 **[EvalLabs](https://github.com/IvandeMurard/Evaluation-Agents-Marketplace)** – Evaluation playground for agents and LLM workflows: compare prompts, models, and flows with product-centric metrics.  
- ☕ **[喫茶 KISSA](https://github.com/IvandeMurard/kissa-project-mvp-B2C)** – Digital twin for your record crate: scan vinyl, get deep Discogs metadata and instant playback, built for selectors and record bars.  
- 🌐 **[Portfolio – ivandemurard.com](https://github.com/IvandeMurard/Ivan-Portfolio)** – My personal site and portfolio, where I document projects, experiments, and talks.

What I'm Doing
--------------

- **Exploring agentic AI for operations** – Applying agents to hospitality, music, and real-world services (from front-desk to record stores).  
- **Shipping AI-native products** – Full-stack builds from prototype to live MVP, with a bias for fast iteration and real usage.  
- **Writing & learning in public** – Sharing notes on product, evals, and AI systems design (Paris-based meetups, talks, and online content).

Legacy / Past Work
------------------

- 🔊 **Sonor** – Co-founded an open-data SaaS to monitor and analyze urban noise, helping cities act on noise pollution.  
- Product roles accross various sectors and company sizes (start-up, scale-up, large corporations).  
- Various experiments around open data, automations, and internal tools that now inform my current agentic AI work.

Media & Speaking
----------------

- Organized a Product Management - Lenny's Newsletter meetup in Paris.
- Joined 5 hackathons, won 2.
- Regularly attend product and AI events and communities.
