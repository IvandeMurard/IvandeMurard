What I'm Doing
--------------

- **Shipping AI-native products** – Full-stack builds from prototype to live MVP, with a bias for fast iteration and real usage.  
- **Writing & learning in public** – Sharing notes on product, evals, and AI systems design (Paris-based meetups, talks, and online content).

Legacy / Past Work
------------------

- 🔊 **Sonor** – Co-founded an open-data SaaS to monitor and analyze urban noise, helping cities act on noise pollution.  
- Product roles accross various sectors and company sizes (start-up, scale-up, large corporations).  
- Various experiments around open data, automations, and internal tools that now inform my current agentic AI work.

Events
----------------

- Organized a Product Management - Lenny's Newsletter meetup in Paris.
